# PURPOSE: Obtain outlines of Canada and Mexico, WITHOUT including
#   the borders between Canada/USA or USA/Mexico.  The user can then
#   use a higher-resolution database like "state" to plot USA
#   boundaries on (at higher resolution than is available for the
#   boundaries of Canada or Mexico.).
# 
# INPUT:
#   No input arguments.
# 
# RETURNS: A list containing two elements "coords" and "units", The
#   element "coords" contains a matrix with the map lines in the
#   projection coordinates.  The element "units" contains the units
#   of the coordinates ("km" or "m").
#
# ASSUMES:
#   Availability of R packages maps.
#
# REVISION HISTORY:
#   Original release: Jenise Swall, 2012-01-11
#
#   2024-06-06 (JLS): Updated code formatting.  Changed argument in
#   call to map() from "region" to "regions", which is the correct
#   argument name.  Specified that calls to na.omit() and dist() are to be made
#   to those functions in the "stats" package.
